### Try running the code

Start by installing dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```

Open a file of any function or algorithm and hover over the types to see the results of "running" that function with some input (try hovering the resulting type).

You can also run tests (written with [tsd](https://github.com/SamVerschueren/tsd)) with:

```
$ yarn test
```
